# Calc V1 ðŸ§®

This is RP2040 (Raspberry Pi Pico) driven calculator using mechanical switches based on the MX-format.

This is my very first *real* physical and polished project and thus im very proud of it as a 14 year old :)

## PCB

The 2 sided PCB was designed in kicad and some rookie experience!
You can find the design files in the kicad folder and production in gerber.


## Installation ðŸ“€

Before installing, it is very important to flash **circuipy** on your Pico. You can download the newest version [here](https://circuitpython.org/board/raspberry_pi_pico/)

Now there are two options:

### Installer (Linux Only!):

1. Open a terminal and cd to your CIRCUITPY-drive
2. run ```git clone https://github.com/Jonathan357611/Calc-V1.git``` there
3. ... and now ```./installer.sh```. The installer will delete all unnecessary files from your Pico!
4. Done!

### Manual

1. Clone the repo ```git clone https://github.com/Jonathan357611/Calc-V1.git```
2. Take these files: code.py font5x8.bin lib/
3. And copy them on your Pico!

That should be it. If you have any troubles installing it, hit me up!
